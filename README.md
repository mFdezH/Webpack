# Webpack
Initial config to use webpack in your project

# STEP ONE

Create a directory and initialize it with: 		npm init -y 

This command creates a file called package.json with a basic information of your project and predetermined values.
In this file will be saved all the depedencies that you will install according to the project's need.

Install webpack dependency locally with:	npm i --save-dev webpack webpack-cli

You will see a new directory called node_modules and a file called package-lock.json. And the file package.json will be updated with the new installed dependencies.
